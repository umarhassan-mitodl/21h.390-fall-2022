## Instructor Interview

**OCW**: What is it like teaching a mixed undergraduate-graduate course? Were there any differences in your expectations for graduate students and undergraduates, other than the fact that the graduate students’ final papers should be longer?

**Kenda Mutongi:** Teaching graduate and undergraduates together was challenging sometimes. There were two very shy undergraduates, and I think they struggled a bit at the beginning. But by gently nudging them to speak up, I was able to help them participate regularly. All the graduate students were marvelous. Those who knew a lot about the topics we were discussing often talked a lot, but in a way that was constructive to everyone; they were not showy at all. We had amazing discussions; there was never a dull moment.

**OCW:** You explicitly specify in the syllabus that students should write “clearly, beautifully, and persuasively.” What are your thoughts on the importance of beauty in academic writing?

**Kenda Mutongi:** I believe beautiful, clear language can convey difficult concepts and ideas much more effectively than jargony language. I also believe that writing clearly is a sign that students really understand what they are talking about.

**OCW:** You asked each student to lead one discussion section by crafting questions for class discussion. How did that work? Did you often have to tweak the students’ questions to stimulate adequate discussion or to guide the discussion in a more fruitful direction?

**Kenda Mutongi:** Yes. But just a bit. I asked students to avoid questions that can be answered with a “yes” or a “no.” I also urged them not to formulate questions that are highly factual. Instead they should use questions that start with “how”; questions that solicit comparisons, reflections. Students were often good at coming up with good questions. Since the questions were posted 24 hours before our class meetings, everybody had the chance to read them before we met. I paired graduate and undergraduate students, and I felt that undergraduates learnt from the graduate students and the graduate students listened to what the undergraduates had to say. I think this worked out very well.

**OCW:** This was your third time teaching the course since 2020. How did the course evolve from one iteration to another? Did you make changes either in the general approach or in specific policies, expectations, or assignments?

**Kenda Mutongi:** Yes. I made a few changes. The first time I taught the course, it was mainly graduate students and we focused largely on historiographical arguments. The last two times the course had lots of undergraduates and I made it more comprehensive; we focused on all the “tools of trade,” such as what a good question is, how to do interviews, what to look for in the archives, how to use theory, how to write clearly, etc.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 12 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

Met 1 time per week for 3 hours per session; 13 sessions total; mandatory attendance.

### Out of Class

Outside of class, students completed assigned readings, wrote assigned papers, and prepared for presentations.

## Response Papers

The success of this class depends on the active participation of all students. You must do all the required readings and come to class ready to actively contribute to class discussions by carefully listening to and engaging with your colleagues. To help you prepare for class discussion, I will require you to write a brief response paper each week of about 500 words.

Class participation and response papers will be 45% of your total grade.
